autohotkey-personal
===================

A repository for my autohotkey scripts that I use personally. I do not claim credit for all the code in this repository, the comments will typically signify which author wrote it. The Exec() function and Hotstrings script are borrowed, while the rest of the files tend to contain most of my original code. The scripts that belong to their respective owners (i.e. not me) may not be in their original forms as I have modified them for my own personal use.
