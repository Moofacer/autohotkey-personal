autohotkey-personal
===================

A repository for my autohotkey scripts that I use personally. I do not claim credit for all the code in this repository, the comments will typically signify which author wrote it. AutoHotKey.ahk, Hotkeys.ahk and custom.ahk (which does borrow Exec()) files tend to contain most of my original code while most others belong to their respective owners. They may not be in their original forms as I have modified them for my own personal use.
